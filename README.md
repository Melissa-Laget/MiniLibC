# MiniLibC project :desktop_computer:

## Done by Melissa - Epitech 2023 :mortar_board:

### Overview

This project is a part of the **second** year of Epitech. <br>
I had **2 weeks** to complete it. :spiral_calendar: <br>

The goal of this project was to discover the assembly language and recreate some libC function in assembly. <br>

The different functions that I was able to recreate are:
- memcpy
- memset
- strcasecmp
- strchr
- strcmp
- strlen
- strncmp
- strrchr

### Running the project locally

From the repo:

- Clone this repostitory locally
- Make a `main.c` to test the functions
- Run `make` in your bash / command line
- Run `./libasm.so`

Here are the different **tools** and **languages** I used to make this project: :hammer_and_wrench:

- Assembly
- VSCode
- GitHub
- Markdown
